Karma GAP is an on-chain protocol designed to streamline grant reporting and enhance transparency for grantees and grant managers. By leveraging blockchain technology, specifically the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), Karma GAP enables grantees to create project profiles, report progress, and document milestones directly on the blockchain. This ensures that project updates, impacts, and achievements are accessible, verifiable, and immutable, fostering trust within the crypto ecosystem.

The platform empowers builders by allowing them to:Create Project Profiles: Showcase their work, goals, and impact in a centralized, on-chain portfolio.
Track Milestones: Break down grant work into clear, verifiable milestones with proof of completion.
Build Reputation: Link team member profiles to projects, enabling individuals to carry their reputation across DAOs and other initiatives.

Karma GAP’s integration with various platforms, including Celo’s Proof of Ship program, amplifies its utility by connecting builders to specific funding and reward opportunities.
