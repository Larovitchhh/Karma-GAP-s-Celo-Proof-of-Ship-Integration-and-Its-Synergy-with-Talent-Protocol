Talent Protocol is a Web3 platform focused on making human potential visible through decentralized reputation data. Built on the Celo blockchain, it provides tools for builders to showcase their skills, connect with opportunities, and monetize their expertise. The platform’s ecosystem includes:Goals App: A Web3 social platform where users can set and bet on each other’s goals, supported by an AI assistant.

Builder.fi: A Q&A marketplace on Base and Farcaster, allowing experts to monetize their knowledge.

Votings App (Upcoming): A social betting game for grants and scholarships, leveraging innovative voting mechanisms.

Talent Protocol’s vision is to create an open, interoperable database of reputation data, akin to a decentralized LinkedIn, where builders can access unique, curated data to unlock economic opportunities. The platform is backed by prominent Web3 players like Celo, Protocol Labs, and Alliance DAO, and it plans to launch its $TAL token in 2024 to further incentivize participation.
